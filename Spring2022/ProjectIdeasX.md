Since I worked on making documentation and a PR for getting graphical utilities to work on WSL during lab, I didn't get to do this part of the lab with my group, so I'm just doing it separately. I'm 100% sure I know exactly how to do the steps for this part with collaborators, though :).

### Possible Projects Ideas
* Creating custom home automation software for use with Rasperry Pis
* Making a GUI (web or ElectronJS) for [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/) or other useful CLI utilities (maybe group several related CLI utilities together?)
* Write code + make a Docker image for a customizable self-hosted Discord bot (or Telegram bot, etc). Maybe even a utility for quickly spinning up bots for different websites (Discord, Telegram, Twitter, etc.)
